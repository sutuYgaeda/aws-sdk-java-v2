The first movement of Virginia describes the adventures and hardships of the first colonists who arrived in Jamestown in 1607. The movement features lively American sounding themes that reflect the spirit of exploration and discovery. The second movement depicts the oppressed slaves on the tobacco plantations, who were introduced in Virginia in 1619. The movement uses a melancholic minor theme and elements of blues to express the sorrow and pain of slavery. The third movement illustrates the American Civil War, which began in 1861 and had a significant impact on Virginia. The movement starts with ceremonial figures from the brass section that announce the war, followed by contrasting themes that represent the conflict and the hope for peace. The piece ends with a slow but optimistic theme that heralds hope for the future.
